EXPERIMNTAL DESIGN | Our project was based on an experimental design from the beginning. We studied the relationship between refugee locations and quantity of refugees. 
We started by identifying the top ten countries of origin and destination. We then studied further metrics on each country based on whether it was a top ten country of origin or asylum. 
We explored the potential statistics that could be displayed and chose a select few that were both meaningful and interesting. 

RESULTS | Our results are largely interactive. While the program looks to highlight certain trends and statistical findings, the goal is to involve the user and allow 
the user to pose questions to the program. Thus, while our findings include the reporting of various numbers, statistics, aggregates, and graphs drom the data we compiled 
regarding world refugees, the findings are also open ended to many possibilities of what the program will enable the user to do to help refugees around the world 
by understanding patterns and demographics.
